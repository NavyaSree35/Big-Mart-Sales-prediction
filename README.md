# Big Mart Sales Prediction using XGBoost Model

This project aims to predict the sales of various products across different stores for the Big Mart retail chain using advanced machine learning techniques, specifically the XGBoost algorithm.

## Introduction

Big Mart is a leading retail chain with stores across various regions. To optimize their inventory management and streamline their business operations, accurate sales predictions are crucial. This project leverages historical sales data along with other relevant features to build a predictive model using XGBoost, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm known for its efficiency and accuracy.

## Data

The dataset used for this project contains historical sales data, including information such as product type, store location, item visibility, and more. It is divided into two sets: a training set used to train the model and a test set used to evaluate its performance.

## Methodology

#### Data Preprocessing: The dataset undergoes thorough preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, feature engineering, and encoding categorical variables.
#### Model Training: XGBoost, a popular gradient boosting algorithm, is employed to train the predictive model using the preprocessed data.
#### Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics to assess its accuracy and generalization performance.
#### Prediction: Finally, the trained model is used to make predictions on the test set to estimate the sales of various products across different stores.
